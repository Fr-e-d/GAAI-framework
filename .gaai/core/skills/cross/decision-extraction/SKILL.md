# Decision Extraction

## Purpose / When to Activate

Activate after:
- Discovery produces epics, scope clarifications, or priorities
- Delivery resolves technical trade-offs or architectural constraints
- QA surfaces systemic issues requiring policy decisions
- Product direction materially changes

Do NOT use for trivial steps, implementation details, brainstorming, or reversible micro-choices.

## Process

0. **Decision Consistency Gate (mandatory).** Before extracting any new decision:
   - Read `contexts/memory/index.md` → scan the Decision Registry by domain to identify relevant existing decisions
   - Load the specific `decisions/DEC-{ID}.md` files for decisions in the affected domain(s)
   - Verify the proposed decision does NOT contradict any active decision
   - If contradiction found: either explicitly supersede (set `superseded_by` in old file + `supersedes` in new file) with rationale, or STOP and escalate to human.
     <!-- Impact list added before escalation to give the human full ripple-effect context
          at decision time. Prevents escalations that lack scope — the human needs to know what
          else references the contradicted decision before resolving it. Drift prevention. -->
     **When escalating due to contradiction:** before surfacing the escalation, grep
     `contexts/` for all occurrences of `DEC-{id}` (where `{id}` is the contradicted decision's
     ID). Collect every file path that references the contradicted DEC — memory files, stories,
     and architecture docs. Present this impact list alongside the escalation message so the human
     can assess scope before deciding.
     **If the `contexts/` directory scan fails:** proceed with the escalation without the impact
     list — the escalation is more important than the impact details.
   - If unable to determine consistency → STOP and escalate to human
   - Never record a decision silently if it may conflict with an existing one

1. Scan outputs for explicit or implicit decisions: architectural choices, accepted trade-offs, scope boundaries, prioritization shifts, constraints introduced
2. Filter strictly for **durable, governance-relevant decisions**
3. **Deduplication check:** Scan the Decision Registry in `index.md` for existing entries covering the same topic. If found: (a) if the new decision supersedes the old, update the old `DEC-{ID}.md` file's frontmatter (`status: superseded`, `superseded_by: DEC-{new-id}`) and record the supersession in the new entry's `supersedes` field; (b) if the new decision confirms the old, skip writing a duplicate.
3b. **Cross-reference assignment:** For the new decision, populate `related_to` with up to 5 DEC IDs that are directly related (same domain cluster, supersession chain, or shared concern). Only include decisions the new entry explicitly builds on, refines, or constrains. If no strong relation exists, leave as `[]`.
4. Convert each into a structured ADR file (see Output Format below):
   - Context
   - Decision
   - Impact
5. Classify using the **10 canonical domains**: `architecture`, `matching`, `expert-system`, `billing`, `booking`, `infrastructure`, `strategy`, `governance`, `market`, `content`. And **3 levels**: `strategic` (WHAT/WHY), `architectural` (HOW), `operational` (PROCESS).
6. **Get next available ID** using `allocate-id.sh dec` (flock + ledger + git-CAS; fallback below);
   write `decisions/DEC-{N}.md`. Keep `decisions/_log.md` updated as the human-readable audit log.

   **Fallback (allocator absent):** scan-verify — grep `decisions/DEC-[0-9]*.md` + `_log.md`
   for highest N, take `N+1`. Warn: `# allocate-id.sh not found — using scan-verify fallback
   (collision possible in concurrent sessions)`. Mirror of the epic/story fallback.
7. **Update `_log.md`:** add one-line entry for the new decision (human-readable log; the allocator
   is the authoritative ID source but `_log.md` remains the topic-searchable audit trail)
8. **MANDATORY GATE — Update Decision Registry (`index.md` or sibling `index-decisions.md` if extracted):** Add one row per new decision. **Row form is pointer-only (per `memory-index-compact` skill, SKILL-MEMORY-INDEX-COMPACT-001):** `| DEC-{N} | {domain} | {level} | {≤30-word topic + key relations e.g. amends/supersedes} | {status} {YYYY-MM-DD} |`. **HARD CAP : ≤ 200 chars per row.** Forbidden in row : Tier 2 cycle trails (F-counts, REFINE narratives), commit SHAs, §-numbered substance dumps duplicating DEC body, validation ceremony prose, drift-heal forensic prose — these live in `_log.md` and the DEC body, NOT in the registry. Increment file count in Shared Categories table. **Verify:** re-read the row + count its chars ; if > 200 chars, compact before completing. Blocking gate — do not output success until confirmed.
9. **Summary range check:** Read the Summaries section of `index.md`. If the new DEC ID exceeds the highest DEC covered by the latest summary file (e.g., summary covers 90–155 but new DEC is 156), append a line to `decisions/_log.md`: `# ⚠️ PENDING: extend summary range to DEC-{new-max-id} — run memory-refresh`. This signals the next `memory-refresh` cycle to extend the summary. Do NOT create a new summary mid-delivery.

## Output Format

Each decision is an individual ADR file: `decisions/DEC-{N}.md` (sequential numeric ID).

## Quality Checks

- All major decisions become explicit memory
- No repeated reasoning across sessions
- Governance trail is traceable
- Memory grows only with high-signal knowledge

---

## Non-Goals

This skill must NOT:
- Summarize entire sessions
- Capture raw logs
- Duplicate existing decisions
- Store trivial steps
- Invent interpretation without artefact support

**If future agents benefit from knowing it → extract it. If not → do not store it. Memory is leverage — not history.**
